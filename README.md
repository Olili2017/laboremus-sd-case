# Laboramus Software Developer Case

This is a reporting tool developed for my Laboramus developer interview

The app is built on NodeJs with NextJS and ReactJs as a framework

## CASE 1:

### Features
  - Upload sales csv report
  - Provide total profit metrics
  - Analyse for the top 5 profitable items

### Action process

  - Open app
  - App launches dashboard
  - if no data metrix to display
  - request user to upload cvs
  - else show metric (features_**)

# ```Points to note```

The app assumes the user is a store manager and is already logged in

## plugins used;

  - react-cvs-reader (reading the csv)
  - next (structure, routing and webpack managment)
  - reactjs (simply UI interations)
  - react-dom (routing)
  - next-images (images)
  - mobx/mobx-react (handling state and context)
